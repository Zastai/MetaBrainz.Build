# MetaBrainz.Build

This is not a standalone project, but rather a collection of build support
files. It is pulled in (as a git submodule) by other `MetaBrainz.xxx`
projects.

## Contents

### Initial Project Contents

These are files that should be copied to the top of a new `MetaBrainz.xxx`
projects (alongside setting up this repository as a `build` submodule).

### MSBuild Support Files

These are properties and targets files that handle some common setup as
well as a shared strong naming key.
